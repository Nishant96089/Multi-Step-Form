# React Multi-Step Form with Bootstrap

This project implements a multi-step form using React.js and styled with Bootstrap. The form consists of three steps for collecting personal information, address information, and confirmation of details.

## Features

- **Multi-Step Form**: Divided into three steps to guide the user through entering their information.
- **Validation**: Client-side validation ensures that all required fields are filled out correctly before progressing to the next step.
- **LocalStorage**: Data entered by the user is stored in the browser's localStorage, allowing users to return to the form and continue where they left off.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to work well on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens using Bootstrap's responsive utilities.
